h1. Performance Invariants

This library implements a Java agent and a couple of annotations to declare performance invariants in Java code.
The implementation is currently incomplete.

For more details on the ideas behind it see: "http://www.codng.com/2011/02/performance-invariants.html":http://www.codng.com/2011/02/performance-invariants.html

h2. Compiling

After you checkout the source code, all you have to do is:
<pre>
~/performance>mvn package
</pre>

h2. Running the agent

You just need to add the agent and jar to the JVM:
<pre>
java -javaagent:$HOME/performance/target/performance-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \ 
	 -Xbootclasspath/a:$HOME/performance/target/performance-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -cp [classpath] MainClass
</pre>
Since it can impact performance, the agent is not automatically installed if it's just included on the classpath, I might change this afterwards.

h2. Annotating Methods

<pre>
import performance.annotations.Expect;

public class Test
{
	static void bah(){}

	@Expect("bah < 10")
	static void foo(){
		for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
			bah();
		}	
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		foo();
	}
}
</pre>
